## Version 0.2.9 — April 30, 2012

  - Upgraded from Streamline 0.2 to 0.3. This allows us to take advantage of
    the new `._coffee` file extension for a bit cleaner code.
  - Unfortunately, Streamline 0.3 requires Node 0.6, and the compiled code
    requires Streamline's runtime, so even though the runtime itself doesn't
    require Node 0.6, our package won't correctly install on Node 0.4 anymore.
    So we now require Node 0.6, but hopefully that's not a big deal. Let us
    know via the issue tracker if this affects you.

## Version 0.2.8 — April 25, 2012

  - Optimized the construction of new object instances in our code. This shows
    >50x improvement when creating or fetching many nodes or relationships.

## Version 0.2.7 — April 22, 2012

  - Reversed the order of `GraphDatabase::query()` from `(callback, query)` to
    `(query, callback)`, to be consistent with our other methods (#20), but
    retained backwards-compatibility -- the old style still works (it just
    logs a warning to the console). Thanks @sprjr for the nudge!

## Version 0.2.6 — April 22, 2012

  - Upgraded from CoffeeScript 1.1 to 1.3 and from Streamline 0.1 to 0.2.
  - More importantly, the published module on npm is now compiled JS! (#17)
    This means better startup performance (no just-in-time compilation) and
    more robustness (no CoffeeScript/Streamline version conflicts). This was
    achieved thanks to Streamline 0.2's new in-file directive, allowing us to
    remove the underscores from our filenames and thus `require()` calls.
    Thanks to @vjeux for bringing this to our attention.

## Version 0.2.5 — March 1, 2012

  - Added support for HTTP Basic Auth by working around the fact that Neo4j
    doesn't maintain the username and password in the URLs it returns (#7).
    Many thanks to @anatoliychakkaev for finding this and suggesting the fix.

## Version 0.2.4 — January 29, 2012

  - Updated library to support Neo4j 1.6. Still supports 1.5 and 1.4. No
    changes were actually needed, but uses the new official Cypher endpoint
    now instead of the deprecated plugin endpoint, if it's available.

## Version 0.2.3 — January 25, 2012

  - Updated library to support Neo4j 1.5. Still supports 1.4.
  - Added a GraphDatabase::getVersion(_) method. Neo4j 1.5 onwards returns the
    version number, so this method returns 1.4 for older versions of Neo4j.

## Version 0.2.2 – January 25, 2012

  - Updated `streamline` dependency to get sync stack traces!
  - Improve handling of error responses from Neo4j.

  - Updated `request` dependency. ([@aseemk][])
  - Added Cypher querying and tests. ([@aseemk][])
  - Better error handling. ([@aseemk][])

    - Rewrote complete library using [Streamline.js][] ([@aseemk][])
    - Massively extended test suite ([@aseemk][])
    - Implemented `Node.getRelationships` method ([@aseemk][])
    - Implemented `Node.getRelationshipNodes` method ([@aseemk][])

    - Implemented `Node.path` method and `Path` class ([@gasi][])
    - Added `Node.createRelationshipFrom` method ([@gasi][])
    - Fixed numerous bugs ([@aseemk][] & [@gasi][])

## Version 0.1.0 – April 20, 2011

  - Rewrote complete library to feature an object-oriented structure.

    nodes and relationship. Internally uses new `serialize` and `deserialize`
